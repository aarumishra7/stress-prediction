# Stress Prediction Project using NLP and Data Visualization with Reddit Data
This project explores the prediction of stress levels based on text data from Reddit using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and data visualization methods.

## Libraries Used:

+ pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
+ matplotlib.pyplot: for data visualization
+ nltk.tokenize: for tokenizing text into words
+ nltk.corpus: for access to stopwords list
+ nltk.stem: for lemmatization of words

## Data:

The project utilizes data extracted from specific Reddit subreddits using the praw library. You will need to provide the subreddit names and credentials (client ID, client secret) for accessing the API.

## Workflow:

### Data Collection:

+ Filter the data based on your criteria (e.g., post length, keywords).
### Data Preprocessing:
#### Clean the text data:
+ Lowercase all words.
+ Remove punctuation and special characters.
+ Tokenize the text into individual words.
+ Remove stop words (common words like "the", "and", etc.).


+ Optionally: Apply lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

#### Feature Engineering:
+ Create features from the processed text data. Examples:
+ Word count
+ Frequency of specific keywords
+ Sentiment analysis score using pre-trained models like VADER
+ Use TF-IDF vectorization to capture word importance

## Model Training:
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) on the features and labels indicating stress levels (manually annotated or inferred from specific subreddits/keywords).

## Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
## Visualization:
+ Use matplotlib to visualize the model's performance and insights from the data. Examples:
Confusion matrix
Feature importance plot
Word cloud of high-stress vs. low-stress text
